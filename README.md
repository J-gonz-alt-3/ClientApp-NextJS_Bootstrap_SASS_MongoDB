# Project Outline

So this is a client project, that I was given permission to make public on my GitHub!

This is a Full Stack, NextJS Web Application!

This project WILL take some time, it is still NOT complete.

Regardless, I've progressed enough to at least show where I currently am, but I want to stress that at the moment I'm only maybe 35% done with this project.

# Tools Used

- NextJS (Framework for Production)
- JavaScript
- API Routing in NextJS (API endpoint created by NextJS - grabs user data and stores in database - data.json)
- SASS/CSS
- MongoDB (DataBase)
- Vercel (for deployment)

# Thoughts so Far

If you are curious as to where I currently am in my project, look at the main-layout.jsx file and I have a running checklist (in comment form).

That checklist is what I am currently planning on working on, but I still have WAYY more to do beyond that checklist.

I plan on implementing a MongoDB database to store User profile for my (Login/Registration) page.

As of writing this, only the Homepage, Services, and About Us pages are fully Responsive. (Update: Are optimized for tablets and larger, actually NOT yet optimized for mobile phones).

All other pages are still incomplete with regards to that and general CSS.

The overall styling of the entire website may change completely as well, but the strcuturing of my elements is fairly decided on at this point so I don't suspect that to change.

But like I said before, still a lot more work to do for this, but I still have time!

Will continue to work on this on a daily basis until agreed upon deadline date!
